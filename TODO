Code cleanup
	- Since free lists are contained by the task. Do not nuke the task free
	  lists on new task creations or destroys.

	- Why is there a mm_cow_pf_handler() and a manual implementation in
	  page_fault()?

	- mm_for_each_dirty_page() could use a more in depth audit

	- Move rng_seed to task structure?

=====================================================
Code Audit

- Ensure prototypes are correct and sane
- Ensure code does not exceed 80 character lines
- Write documentation for any undocumented functions
- Read through code and make sure usage is sane and safe
- Add to the TODO list for any things that cannot be immediately fixed, or
  future ideas
- Check for security bugs
- Check for race conditions on globals and current_cpu
- Make sure SAL annotations are correct and as verbose as possible
